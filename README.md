# rotenc

This is PCB design and example qmk_firmware keymap implementation to add-on rotary encoders (jog dials) to your keyboards.

# Usage

Open EAGLE design file in ./pcb.
I used elecrow to print the board.
I will distribute printed PCBs by 200 JPY + shipping.


Copy keymap to qmk_firmware/keyboards/kets_split/keymaps/foobar and write.

```
make lets_split/rev2:foobar_onehanded:avrdude
```
